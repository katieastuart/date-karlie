So things that are useful but really have few benefits.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">I seriously love to travel. It’s one of my favorite joys in life. Especially if I get to go to museums (see artistic ability). I have been to 12 different countries and have plans to eventually go to more. If you do not like traveling that’s totally fine, my sister goes with me on most of my trips so if you don’t want to go I‘ll go with her instead!</p>

                        <p class="card-text">While you may be able to do equations at the drop of a hat, historical facts are where my I succeed. What with the historical nature of my college degree, and the fact that everyone in my family adores history, I have amassed an acute knowledge of World and American history that I can recall with ease. You will never have to write a report ever again.</p>

                                    <br>Also, I’m really good at puns.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">While I think the fact that you watch The Lord of the Rings extended editions is a positive and not a negative since I love them too. I do have to say I will be watching the Harry Potter movie marathons that are on USA almost every weekend, all 8 movies. (Though you need not join me if you are not inclined).</p>
